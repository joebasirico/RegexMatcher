The RegexMatcher is a simple .net tool to help you write and verify regular expressions. Simply type the regular expression in the top text box and the text you'd like to match below. If there is no match the window will turn red. If there is a match the window will turn green and the matches and captures will be displayed in the right text box.

If there is an issue with your regular expression you can get help by hovering over the ! icon to the right of the regex textbox.

You can configure the regex engine to match your desired behavior by checking or unchecking the boxes at the top right of the window.
